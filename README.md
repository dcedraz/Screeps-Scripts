## This repo is meant for keeping saved all scripts written for the game Screeps.com


#### It started as a clone of the [screeps-typescript-starter kit](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter)  repository.

The code is written within the src directory, the `.ts` files are converted into the `main.js` within the `dist` folder using rollup packager manager.
